I am currently a graduate student at the University of Chicago, pursuing a Masters degree in Analytics. Prior to UChicago, I worked in analytics consulting and specialized in data science and data visualization across a variety of tools and platforms. Outside of my professional life, I am a passionate student of architectural history and a dedicated volunteer at PAWS Chicago.
